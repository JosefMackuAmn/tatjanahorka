Backend:
- Send an email to all registered email addresses after creating new event

Frontend:
- Modal for /?success=true or /?success=false: Alert on (un)successful email registration
- Flowers in the background instead of green stains
- Add animations to photos (maybe slow zooming in and out in the .passed-events section and on other photos similar effect as it is in the current website)
- Add leafs
- Change the shape of the background of the .organizations section
- Dynamically display passed events

Design:
- First section redesign (add Táňa's book and change the way events are displayed)
